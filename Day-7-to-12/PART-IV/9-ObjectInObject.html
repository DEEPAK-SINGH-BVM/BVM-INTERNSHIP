    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    Questions: 1. Add a new property to your myObject called favoriteFoods and
    set it equal to an array containing a list of three strings. 2. Access your
    myObject's second favorite food and print it to the console using
    console.log() 3. Create a new variable called firstFavFood and set it equal
    to the first item in your myObject's array of favorite foods. 4. Add another
    food to the end of the list. 5. Print the length of your myObject's
    favoriteFoods array to the console with console.log() 6. Without modifying
    any of your previous code, write a new line of code that changes the value
    of the last item in the list to "pineapples" (overwriting the previous
    value). 7. Create a new variable named lastFavFood that will always point to
    the last element of your myObject's favoriteFoods array, no matter how many
    items are in the list. 8. Write a for loop to iterate through every food in
    your myObject's favoriteFood property and print each one to the console. 9.
    Add a new property to your myObject called outfit and set it equal to
    another object with the following properties: hat, shirt, pants, and shoes
    -- each property should have a string as its value! (I suggest you give it a
    baseball cap, Hawaiian shirt, cargo shorts, and flip-flops.) 10. Create anew
    variable called penguinHatType and set it equal to the value of the hat in
    your myObject's outfit! Then print your new variable to the console.
    11.Without modifying any of your previous code, write one new line of code
    to add an accessory property to your myObject's outfit and set it equal to
    the string "pocket watch" -- because penguins are classy like that! 12.
    Write one more line of code to change the hat in your myObject's outfit to
    "top hat" and override the previous value. (Again, because penguins are
    classy!) 14. Let's delete the pants property from this myObject's outfit
    property. 15. Write a for ... in loop to print the value of each piece of
    clothing in your myObject's outfit so you can see a list of clothing items
    in the console.
