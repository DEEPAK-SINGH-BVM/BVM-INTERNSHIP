    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    /*
    Questions:
    1. Add a new property to your myObject called favoriteFoods and set it equal to an array containing a list of three
    strings.
    2. Access your myObject's second favorite food and print it to the console using console.log()
    3. Create a new variable called firstFavFood and set it equal to the first item in your myObject's array of favorite
    foods.
    4. Add another food to the end of the list.
    5. Print the length of your myObject's favoriteFoods array to the console with console.log()
    6. Without modifying any of your previous code, write a new line of code that changes the value of the last item in
    the list to "pineapples" (overwriting the previous value).
    7. Create a new variable named lastFavFood that will always point to the last element of your myObject's
    favoriteFoods array, no matter how many items are in the list.
    8. Write a for loop to iterate through every food in your myObject's favoriteFood property and print each one to the
    console.
    9. Add a new property to your myObject called outfit and set it equal to another object with the following
    properties: hat, shirt, pants, and shoes -- each property should have a string as its value! (I suggest you give it
    a baseball cap, Hawaiian shirt, cargo shorts, and flip-flops.)
    10. Create a new variable called penguinHatType and set it equal to the value of the hat in your myObject's outfit!
    Then print your new variable to the console.
    11. Without modifying any of your previous code, write one new line of code to add an accessory property to your
    myObject's outfit and set it equal to the string "pocket watch" -- because penguins are classy like that!
    12. Write one more line of code to change the hat in your myObject's outfit to "top hat" and override the previous
    value. (Again, because penguins are classy!)
    14. Let's delete the pants property from this myObject's outfit property.
    15. Write a for ... in loop to print the value of each piece of clothing in your myObject's outfit so you can see a
    list of clothing items in the console.
