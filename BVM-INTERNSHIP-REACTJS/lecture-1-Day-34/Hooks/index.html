            * npm view react version
            * ReactJs is Build by FaceBook
        1) What is ReactJS
            => React is a JavaScript Library use for Making UserInterFace
               React is use to build Single Page Application 
               React allow to make Reusable UI components 

        2) How Does ReactJS Work 
            => Instead of manipulating the browser's DOM Directly React Create a Virtual DOM in Memory,
            where it does all the necessary manipulating , before making the changes in browser DOM  

        3) What is JSX  
            => JSX is JavaScript XML
            which helps to Write HTML Code in React

        4) What is Components 
            => Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in
            isolation and return HTML.

        5) What are Props 
            => Props are argument to pass react Components

        6) What are events 
            => Just like DOM Event , React can perform Action base on Events
               React has Same Event onclick onchange etc
            DIFFERENCE:
               In React Events are written in camelCase Syntax (onClick , OnChanges)
               In React Events are written in Curly Brackets
               onclick="shoot()" ===> onClick={shoot}
            EXAMPLE:   
               <button onclick="shoot()">Click</button>      
               <button onClick={shoot}>Click</button>

        7) React Router
            => Setup Key : npm i -D react-router-dom@latest
        i)  Conditional Router : causes entities to choose a routing based on some condition (usually a name or other entity )
        ii) Protected Router   : Protected routes are routes within a React application that require authentication or authorization before allowing access to specific components or views.
        
        * Authentication : is a process to verify the users are attempting to access to the application username-password authentication .
        * Authorization  : users have the necessary permissions to access specific resources or perform certain actions within the application
        
        8) What is Hooks
            => Hooks Allow to allow function Components to have Access to state and allow Other React Feature
            * LifeCycle Methods = (Mounting , Updating , UnMounting)
        
        9) What is UseSate
            => UseSate is Use for manage state
            (current State) , (update State) (initial value)
            const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

        10) What is useEffect
            => useEffect is allow you to perform side effect in you components 
                For Example : fetching data, directly updating the DOM, and timers.
        
        11) What is Context 
            => React Context is a way to manage state Globally  
            To do this without Context, we will need to pass the state as "props" through each nested component. This is called
            "prop drilling".
        
        12) What is useRef
            => The useRef Hook allows you to persist values between renders.
            It can be used to store a mutable value that does not cause a re-render when updated.
            It can be used to access a DOM element directly
            
        13) What is useReducer'
            => useReducer is a alternative of useState it handle Complex logic
               useReducer accept two argument 
               To update whatâ€™s on the screen, call dispatch 
               The dispatch function returned by useReducer lets you update the state to a different value and trigger a re-render.
        
        14) What is useCallback
            => The useCallback Hook is a built-in React Hook that memoizes(computations are only executed when necessary) a callback function 
                The useCallback Hook only runs when one of its dependencies update.

        15) What is useMemo
            => The React Memo hook Return Memoizes Value , it run only when dependencies update
   
        16) what is LayOutEffect
            => useLayOutEffect is similar to useEffect , it executed sync after all DOM mutations , 
               This makes it useful for manipulating the DOM immediately after a component is rendered
        
       17) What is useDebug
            => useDebugValue is a hook that allows you to display custom debugging information for custom hooks 

       18) What is useImperativeHandle
            => he useImperativeHandle hook allows you to customize the instance value that is exposed to parent components when using ref,
               it don't want to expose all of the internal implementation details of a child component
               two arguments: the ref object and a callback function that returns an object

       19) What is Custom Hook
            => React Custom Hooks are reusable functions that start with "use". They let you extract logic (like fetching data or
            managing state) from a component and share it across others. This keeps components clean and organized, promoting better
            code maintainability
