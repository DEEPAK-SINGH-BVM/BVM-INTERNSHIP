               React allow to make Reusable UI components 

        2) How Does ReactJS Work 
            => Instead of manipulating the browser's DOM Directly React Create a Virtual DOM in Memory,
            where it does all the necessary manipulating , before making the changes in browser DOM  

        3) What is JSX

            which helps to Write HTML Code in React

        4) What is Components 
            => Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in
            isolation and return HTML.

        5) What are Props 
            => Props are argument to pass react Components

        6) What are events 
            => Just like DOM Event , React can perform Action base on Events

            DIFFERENCE:
               In React Events are written in camelCase Syntax (onClick , OnChanges)
               In React Events are written in Curly Brackets
               onclick="shoot()" ===> onClick={shoot}

        i)  Conditional Router : causes entities to choose a routing based on some condition (usually a name or other entity )
        ii) Protected Router   : Protected routes are routes within a React application that require authentication or authorization before allowing access to specific components or views.
        
        * Authentication : is a process to verify the users are attempting to access to the application username-password authentication .
        * Authorization  : users have the necessary permissions to access specific resources or perform certain actions within the application
        
        8) What is Hooks
            => Hooks Allow to allow function Components to have Access to state and allow   Other React Feature
            * LifeCycle Methods = (Mounting , Updating , UnMounting)
