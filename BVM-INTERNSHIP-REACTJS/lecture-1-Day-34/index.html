               React is use to build Single Page Application 
               React allow to make Reusable UI components 

        2) How Does ReactJS Work 
            => Instead of manipulating the browser's DOM Directly React Create a Virtual DOM in Memory,
            where it does all the necessary manipulating , before making the changes in browser DOM  

        3) What is JSX  
            => JSX is JavaScript XML
            which helps to Write HTML Code in React

        4) What is Components 
            => Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in
            isolation and return HTML.

        5) What are Props 
            => Props are argument to pass react Components

        6) What are events 
            => Just like DOM Event , React can perform Action base on Events
               React has Same Event onclick onchange etc
            DIFFERENCE:
               In React Events are written in camelCase Syntax (onClick , OnChanges)
               In React Events are written in Curly Brackets
               onclick="shoot()" ===> onClick={shoot}
            EXAMPLE:   
               <button onclick="shoot()">Click</button>      
               <button onClick={shoot}>Click</button>
